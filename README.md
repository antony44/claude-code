# Claude Code Excellence Repository

This repository is a comprehensive monorepo designed for building web applications and video automation using Claude Code. It contains:

- **apps/**: Independent applications and examples (web, Next.js, SaaS starters, Remotion projects).
- **skills/**: Reusable primitives and building blocks organized by domain (web, video, infra, shared).
- **templates/**: Base scaffolds you can copy to create new projects quickly.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including architectural guidelines.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Guidelines for using Claude Code with this repository.

The goal is to provide a clean, maintainable codebase that you can clone or use as a template for your projects. Keep the skills library lean and focused on primitives that can be reused across applications.

To get started:
1. Clone this repository or copy it as a template.
2. Navigate to the appropriate `apps/` directory to run or develop an application.
3. Explore `skills/` to see available primitives and utilities.
4. Read `docs/architecture.md` for a deeper understanding of the architecture.

Enjoy building!
